Since there is a dog not named for a Spice that is playing catch, Nugmeg is going for a walk because Bear is playing catch.
Since Bear is playing catch, this means that Pepper is burying a chew toy.
The only two dogs left are Ginger and Saber.
Since ginger is the name of a Spice, they are getting their ears scratched because Saber is not a name for spice.
By process of elinimation, this means that Saber is the only one left, and they are taking a nap.

Ginger = Ears Scratched
Bear = Playing Catch
Saber = Napping
Pepper = Burying a Chew Toy
Nutmeg = Walking

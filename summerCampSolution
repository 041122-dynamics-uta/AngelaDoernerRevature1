Since Blake enjoys having his feet on the ground, the best activity is for him to cook in the kitchen
Since Rosa can't do her favorite activity without a harness, she enjoys either rock climbing or zip-lining.
Those are the only two activities that require a harness.
Since Oliver is afraid of heights, the only choice left for himm (by process of elimination) is kayaking.
Abigail does not enjoy rock climbing, so the only option left for her is zip-lining.
Since rock climbing is the only activity left, this is Rosa's favorite activity.

Blake = kitchen
Rosa = rock climbing
Oliver = Kayaking
Abigail = zip-lining

As the evidence suggest, Millard's birthday is on Thursday.
Since John's birthday is before Abe's and William's birthday is after Abe's, the most logical order would be that John's is on Monday, Abe is on Wednesday, and William's is on Friday.
By process of elimination, George's birthday is the only one left which takes place on Tuesday.

John = Monday
George = Tuesday
Abe = Wednesday
Millard = Thursday
William = Friday

Since there is no one taller than Zina and Weldon, they are the two tallest.
Leisha and Delia are taller than Benito, which makes them the second two tallest.
Leisha has to be third or fourth because Benito is not the shortest but shorter than two people
Weldon cannot be the two shortest
Zina cannot be the two shortest.
By process of elimination, this makes Charlotte the shortest.

1 = shortest, 6 = tallest
1 = Charlotte
2 = Benito
3 = Leisha
4 = Delia
5 = Weldon
6 = Zina

Since Flora has seasonal allergies, the only possible allergy for her to have is pollen.
Since Allegra only has a food allergy, she can only be allergic to shellfish or nuts.
Clara's allergy is not related to animals, which makes nuts the only viable option.
By process of elimination, this means that Allegra's allergy is shellfish.
Since Ben does not have a cat allergy, the only viable option for him is Bees.
Finally, this leves Zach with an allergy for cats.

Allegra = Shellfish
Ben = Bees
Clara = Nuts
Flora = Pollen
Zach = Cats

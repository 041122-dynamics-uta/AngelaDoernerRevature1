Since Blake enjoys having his feet on the ground, the best place for him is cooking in the kitchen.
Since Rosa can't do her favorite activity without a harness, she enjoys either rock-climbing or zip-lining. Those are the only two activities that require a harness.
Since Oliver is afraid of heights, he can't do rock-climbing or zip-lining. The only choice left (by process of elimination) is kayaking.
Abigail does not enjoy rock climbing, so the only option left for her to do is zip-lining.
Since rock climbing is the only activity left in the list, this is Rosa's favorite activity.

Abigail = zip-line
Oliver = Kayak
Rosa = rock-climb
Blake = cooking
